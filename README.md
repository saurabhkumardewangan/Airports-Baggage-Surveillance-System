# Airports-Baggage-Surveillance-System
Project is about Airports Baggage Surveillance System to detect the banned substances or to detect the possible threats entering to the country. For this we need to ensure the operators working at the airports are performing well. So in this project we are going to assess the operators performance working at different level of X-BIS.
